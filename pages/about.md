# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
currently student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, majoring in Information Sciences. 
I am really passionate about utilizing data to find new insights and present my findings in understandable and unique ways.

Currently I am the president of the Hong Kong Student Association at UIUC as well as the Head of Business Analytics for Illini EV Concept.
Definitely checkout these two student organizations if either one speaks to you, as myself and the exec board of both these student organizations
pride ourselves on being open and accessible to any interested students.
